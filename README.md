# Battleship
Text-based battleship game in the Python terminal  
This was made as a final project for TAMU's ENGR 102  

### Some features:
- Supports both single amd multiplayer
- Singleplayer has a smart AI (slightly higher winrate against me)
- Customizable number of ships (up to 9)
- Cheat mode to look at enemy's ship
